I originally wrote fbsetbg, a shellscript provided with fluxbox. I
was not terribly happy with it since all the portability concerns
and after some long thinking I decided it would be best if fbsetbg
was written in C. Only problem was that I was a C-noob. So this is
my learning project.

I think the code is pretty acceptable as it is right now. Of
course splitting all the functions into seperate files is silly,
but... instructive. I learned lot from the splitting.

But any C guru who thinks he knows some improvements, please do
send comments or patches. I love more fresh insights.

THANKS

  Marco Gerards, for auditing my code so far.
