Optionally you can install libbsd to get better randomness,so:

   sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev

Just run the usual:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


If you want to add compilerflags do it like this:

    make CFLAGS="-O2 -fstack-protector"


If you don't like the installation pathes you can change them like this:

    sudo make install prefix=/usr mandir=/usr/share/man


Take a closer look at the Makefile.in to see what's possible.
